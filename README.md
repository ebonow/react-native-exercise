# React Native - Vehicle Browser

> Forked from: https://github.com/flexdrive/react-native-exercise

## Given: Problem

Create a React Native frontend with a Node (micro) backend that allows a customer to browse a list of vehicle, see vehicle details, and submit an order.


### Given: Required Views

1. Vehicle List
2. Vehicle Details
3. Success Page

### Given: Guidelines

1. Check into Git periodically
2. Use whichever libraries you like
3. Take 1-2 hours on it
4. Document your assumptions, describe what else would need to be done to make it "production-ready."
5. Send us a link to your git repo.

### Given: What We Are Looking For

1. Coding style
2. Knowledge of React Native, JS or aptitude to quickly pick it up and contribute on a React Native project.


### First Impression

This is my first React Native project so I anticipate a learning curve for:

1. Styles

2. Navigation

3. Animation (back button, left to right page flow, etc...)

4. OS Fragmentation - I doubt an hour or two would be enough to familiarize myself with the components well enough to know which OS equivelents serve the best needs so this will be as generic as possible first pass.


### Takeaways
TBD: still in development...
